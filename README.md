### Hi there üòÑ

My name is Thiago Moreira and I'm the fastest man alive... I mean, I'm a Fullstack Systems Analyst and  Multidisciplinary Bachelor from UFBA (Federal University of Bahia). Always trying to improve I constantly seek for new experiencies, like back in the day when I was a Orchestra Musician (üéª) or a seller (üè¨). I'm a member of the [ICON LAB](http://icon.ufba.br) and we have a lot of projects that could interest you like [Radioca Loop](http://beat.radioca.com.br). Here in my repo, you will be able to see some of the projects that I'm currently working or studying. Feel free to reach out any time via LinkedIn or E-mail.

My hobbies are play games (üéÆ), watch basketball (üèÄ) and search something cool in YouTube (üì∫).

üå± I‚Äôm currently studying Azure, NoSQL and Kafka. Also review my knowledge in .NET as well.

üì´ You can find me on:
